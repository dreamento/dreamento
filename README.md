# ZmaxDonders

## Overview

ZmaxDonders is a software that is written in Python to control Hypnodyne Zmax headbands while monitoring/analyzing its EEG data. The software allows researchers to load their own or pre-trained deep learning models to classify different phases of sleep via single-channel EEG data. The developers have done their best to build it in a modular and open-source fashion, such that other researchers can add their own features to it and extend it further. 

Another remarkable feature of it is plotting spectrogram and periodogram of the EEG data in real-time. These plots contain a reach amount of information that can contribute to the inference of the experimenters.
